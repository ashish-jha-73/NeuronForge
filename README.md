# ðŸ§  NeuronForge

**NeuronForge** is a minimalist, educational neural network library built entirely from scratch using Python and NumPy â€” no machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. It aims to demystify the inner workings of deep learning by exposing every component, from forward propagation to backpropagation.

> ðŸ”§ *Forge your own neurons. Understand the core. No black boxes.*
